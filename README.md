# StarProjector - A Night Sky Simulator for Apple Watch

## Description
StarProjector is an Apple Watch app that simulates a starry night sky, providing a calming and immersive experience. Inspired by the concept of a digital fidget spinner, this app is designed to help users relax and potentially fall asleep by offering a soothing visual of moving stars.

## Background
The idea for StarProjector came to me during a restless night when I was having trouble falling asleep. As I lay in bed, I raised my arm and noticed my Apple Watch. It struck me that the watch's screen could serve as a small window to a virtual night sky. 

I've always found stargazing to be a calming activity, and I wanted to recreate that experience in a portable, accessible format. The Apple Watch, with its compact screen and Digital Crown, seemed like the perfect device for this concept.

Additionally, I've always enjoyed the satisfying feel of scrolling the Digital Crown, and I wanted to incorporate that tactile experience into the app. By integrating haptic feedback with the star movement, I aimed to create a multi-sensory experience that could aid in relaxation and sleep.

## Features
- Infinite star field simulation
- Interactive control using the Apple Watch's Digital Crown
- Haptic feedback integration for an enhanced sensory experience

## Usage
StarProjector is perfect for those moments when you're having trouble falling asleep:

1. Lie down in bed and raise your arm to view your Apple Watch.
2. Open the StarProjector app.
3. Use the Digital Crown to navigate through the star field.
4. Enjoy the calming effect of the moving stars until you drift off to sleep.

## What I Learned
Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable experience in various aspects of Apple Watch app development:

1. Utilizing the Xcode simulator for Apple Watch app testing and debugging
2. Implementing version control by integrating GitHub with Xcode
3. Configuring iPhone and Apple Watch devices for development purposes
4. Establishing a connection between Apple Watch and Xcode for live application testing
5. Configuring Xcode project settings to manage minimum deployment targets for watchOS

These skills not only contributed to the successful creation of StarProjector but also enhanced my overall proficiency in iOS and watchOS development.

## Future Improvements
1. Refine haptic feedback to respond more accurately to Digital Crown movement
2. Optimize performance for smoother animations
3. Implement a slow, automatic star field movement when the Digital Crown is not in use

## Requirements
- watchOS 10.0+
- Compatible with Apple Watch SE (1st gen) and newer models
